# DV360 Automation

## Overview

The following source code accompanies the Display & Video 360 Automation workshop, an interactive workshop for DV360 advertisers to explore functionality of the [Display & Video 360 API](https://developers.google.com/display-video/api/reference/rest). 

It is intended to provide a snapshot of the available functionality and is by no means an exhaustive look at all features of the API. The .ipynb notebook is intended for use within [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), but could be adapted to work in other Jupyter notebook environments.

For additional support using the DV360 API, refer to the [official developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/display-video/api/guides/getting-started/overview).
